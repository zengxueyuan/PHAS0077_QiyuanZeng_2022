## Coding
This project contains three ipynb code which have been labeled based on their running order

- 1. Data pre-process.ipynb

        This file is to integrate eight thyroid dataset files into one csv file.

- 2. Data analysis.ipynb

        Analyse the distribution of our dataset and handling the missing value problem

- 3. Modelling.ipynb

        Using ten machine learning algorithms to train thyroid classification prediction models.

## Data sets

1. Download the dataset from UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/thyroid+disease), and store it into _Raw dataset_ file.

2. Transfer the .data and .test files in raw dataset into csv file so that we can read and process easily. These processed data are stored in 'Dataset' file

3. 'Dataset_edited' is a folder to store the data which have been cleaned and integrated in our research.
